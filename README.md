# Rain Soaked Fares
A multi-data source pipeline for analysis and forecast of transportation business under weather events.

## Introduction
Weather is a major source of risk and uncertainty for some businesses, hence the importance understanding the historical pattern and forecasting. My objective is to create a simple tool for studying business operations and interactions between businesses in relation to weather. This might help businesses to better forecast demands, minimize adverse impacts due to weather, improve user experience, identify new business opportunities and prepare for long-term effects such as climate change.
